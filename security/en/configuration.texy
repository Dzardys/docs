Configuring Access Control
**************************

.[perex]
Overview of configuration options for the Nette Security.

You can define a list of users in the configuration to create a [simple authenticator|authentication] (`Nette\Security\SimpleAuthenticator`). Because passwords are readable in the configuration, this solution is for testing purposes only.

```neon
security:
	# shows user panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...  # (bool) defaults to true

	users:
		# name: password
		johndoe: secret123

		# name, password, role and other data available in the identity
		janedoe:
			password: secret123
			roles: [admin]
			data: ...
```

You can also define roles and resources to create a basis for [authorizer|authorization] (`Nette\Security\Permission`):

```neon
security:
	roles:
		guest:
		registered: [guest]  # registered inherits from guest
		admin: [registered]  # and admin inherits from registered

	resources:
		article:
		comment: [article]   # resource inherits from article
		poll:
```
